            <h2>Exploring Google Earth Engine, Machine Learning, and GIS for Land Use Land Cover Change Detection in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, between 2014 and 2023</h2>
            <p>This study aims to visualize various land use land cover (LULC) classes, estimate the net change in LULC types between the years 2014 and 2023, and use transition mapping to track LULC transitions within waterbody, vegetation, bareland, and buildup to better understand how land use types change from one another.</p>

            <h2>Geospatial assessment of environmental factors and flooding occurrences in Borno Metropolis, Northeastern Nigeria (1987â€“2024)</h2>
            <p>This study explores the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) changes, rainfall patterns, and floods in Borno Metropolis, Nigeria, during the 2024 floods.</p>

            <h2>Geospatial Assessment of Land Use/ Land Cover of the Federal Capital Territory: A Case Study for The Year 2050</h2>
            <p>This study presents the geospa al assessment of LULCC in the FCT (Federal Capital Territory) of Nigeria over a 35-year period, selecting the following years: 1987, 2002, 2011, and 2022, based on low cloud cover using remote sensing imagery and GIS techniques. By incorporating integrated cellular automata (CA)-Markov module from IDRISI-TerrSet soware, the year 2050 was predicted.</p>
